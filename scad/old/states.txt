States for the turing machine from Wolfram's 5x2

Symbols (1,2,3,4,5) = Green, Yellow, Blue, Magenta, Red
States = Up, Down

Symbol State -----> Symbol State Dir
------ -----        ------ ----- ---
1      Up           2      Down  Back
2      Up           1      Down  Fwd
3      Up           5      Up    Fwd
4      Up           5      Up    Fwd
5      Up           4      Up    Back
1      Down         3      Down  Back
2      Down         1      Down  Fwd
3      Down         1      Up    Fwd
4      Down         5      Up    Fwd
5      Down         2      Up    Back

Facing the front of the turing machine
Symbols 1-5 go from left to right. 1= left, 5=right

The maze is position with the longest channel towards you (=towards the front of the machine)

In the 'up" state, the state bar sends the marbles away from you.
In the "up" state, the state must be flipped on inputs 1 and 2 (the two leftmost inputs)

In the "down" state, the state must be flipped on inputs 3,4 and 5 (the thee rightmight inputs)

Our current statebar has been verified correct. (1st Aug 2010)
