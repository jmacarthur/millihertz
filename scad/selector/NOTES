# Notes from the first laser cut prototype on 01/07/2017

* The output rods don't quite fit into the end plate; we need to round off the top corners on them to make them fit in. [FIXED?]
* There's no easy way of locating the input combs front-back when assembling.

* The input combs and output rod combs are too tight, especially for 3.2mm acrylic rods, and need to be loosened a bit. The lever comb if anything is too loose and could do with fitting another comb in to keep them straight. Note that this was due to variation in the thickness of the acrylic used; it was 3.1mm on one side and 3.3mm on the other side of the sheet. [Rear comb fixed]

* We need to simulate the interconnects with nuts and bolts to see if they fit.
* Update the 2D file to account for changes to the new design.

* I don't think staggering is necessary on the input rods for the selector. If we remove it we can use one rod for the axles through the interconnects. We'd then need to glue in the lever pinions, maybe ordering some 9mm dowels to go in there.
# Fixed things

* There's too much travel on the input rods; I don't have the back plate attached, which may help, but we should put more bumps on to limit their travel. [FIXED]
* Lever lifter doesn't lift the levers high enough; the slots for it could do with being longer [FIXED]
* Lever lifter bar doesn't sit in the slot at the front. [FIXED]
* There isn't enough space for the follower raiser in the end plates. Simply making the space in the end plates bigger would fix it. [FIXED]
* The lower tabs on the output bars need to be longer; at least as long as the travel of the output. [FIXED]



# Notes from the second laser cut protoype on 22/07/2017

* We have cut some of the wrong parts because the parameters to xBars had to be copied from the 3D assembly to the 2D diagram. We should do all the parameters in one place and make specific 2D modules for each part which contain the parameters.
* The output drive plate can't move far enough forward because it's blocked by the short output comb. We can't trim the end of this, but we can move everything backwards by the required amount. This just requires cutting a longer slot on the guide on the far right and adjusting the output sum bars.
