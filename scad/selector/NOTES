# Notes from the first laser cut prototype on 01/07/2017

* The output rods don't quite fit into the end plate; we need to round off the top corners on them to make them fit in.
* There's no easy way of locating the input combs front-back when assembling.
* There isn't enough space for the follower raiser in the end plates. Simply making the space in the end plates bigger would fix it.
* The input combs and output rod combs are too tight, especially for 3.2mm acrylic rods, and need to be loosened a bit. The lever comb if anything is too loose and could do with fitting another comb in to keep them straight.
* There's too much travel on the input rods; I don't have the back plate attached, which may help, but we should put more bumps on to limit their travel.
