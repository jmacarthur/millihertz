# Notes from the first laser cut prototype on 01/07/2017

* The output rods don't quite fit into the end plate; we need to round off the top corners on them to make them fit in. [FIXED?]
* There's no easy way of locating the input combs front-back when assembling.
* There isn't enough space for the follower raiser in the end plates. Simply making the space in the end plates bigger would fix it.
* The input combs and output rod combs are too tight, especially for 3.2mm acrylic rods, and need to be loosened a bit. The lever comb if anything is too loose and could do with fitting another comb in to keep them straight. Note that this was due to variation in the thickness of the acrylic used; it was 3.1mm on one side and 3.3mm on the other side of the sheet.
* There's too much travel on the input rods; I don't have the back plate attached, which may help, but we should put more bumps on to limit their travel.
* Lever lifter doesn't lift the levers high enough; the slots for it could do with being longer
* Lever lifter bar doesn't sit in the slot at the front; needs to be a bit longer (but that would foul the interconnects)
* The lower tabs on the output bars need to be longer; at least as long as the travel of the output. [FIXED]
