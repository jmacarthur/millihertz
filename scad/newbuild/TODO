TODO List for Turing machine

(2012/03/31): Tabs for punt baseplate are on all chassis beams. they should just be on the inside ones (or the baseplate should be modified to accept them)
(2012/03/31): Square holes for cams etc are a tiny bit too small.
(2012/03/31): Did not include the small direction cam in the layout.
(2012/03/31): Etching of logo on front lifter isn't very distinct.
(2012/03/31): Magnet holes are slightly too small.
(2012/04/04): It's really difficult to glue up the lifters. Give them fewer degrees of freedom!
(2012/04/04): There aren't any holes in the follower arms.
(2012/04/04): No guide to where the baseplates for the followers should be stuck on.
