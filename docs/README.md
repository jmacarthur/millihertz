# Millihertz mechanical computing repository

![3D printed rule 110 robot]({{site.url}}/110bot.jpeg)

This is a repository of CAD/CAM parts and text descriptions for mechanical and unusual computing.

* Diagrams: 2D explanatory diagrams, usually for documentation.
* scad: Models used to make Turing machine.
* scad/old: Plans for my first Turing machine, which was largely handmade. Only the 'maze' part of this was actually used in the finished machine.
* scad/newbuild: Plans for the V2 Turing machine, which was laser-cut. The finished V2 machine was closer to the plans, but some post-cutting modifications were still necessary.
* scad/110: Plans for two verions of the rule 110 automaton; one intended for 3d printing and one for laser cutting.

Please note that none of the plans in here are intended for people to make directly. They are likely to be unfinished and contain errors. They are also not very well documented, which may improve over time.
